### Welcome!

This web app has _two_ program purposes:
1. A built in skill planner that help a user gauge their ability and arrange schedule, which should also provide a visual way to display their skill sets and program timeline.
2. Help those prospect students assess their own circumstances and achieve a best fit program by connecting them with those who has already attended it.

---
Besides that I will also implement a commenting and reviewing component, though not the focus, I believe its important to have a reputation system in this app.

* The first step of this web app is to construct a place where users could easily display their skill sets and programs, also communicate with each other through Q&A.

* The second stage will then focus on building a querying system and analysing page for our uses to choose the program/course that best fit them.
